At the python conole enter filename, and then enter the 'exec...' line at your given path. Mine shown
by example below for linux.
The windows path version I believe, for example, would be given by 
'filename = \\home\\strangequark2\\...' and so forth or '\\' between
windows folder/directories for proper python pathing.

filename = "/home/strangequark2/BlenderPythonScripts/insetextrude.py"
exec(compile(open(filename).read(), filename, 'exec'))
